                    <p>Blue jays, those vibrant feathered acrobats of the treetops, are a common sight in eastern North America. With their striking blue plumage, jaunty crests, and a penchant for mischief, they’re like the avian equivalent of a jazz band—always improvising and making a splash.
                    <p>Clever birds aren’t just about looks, though. They’ve got brains to match their beauty. Blue jays are known for their intelligence and complex social structures. Plus, they’ve got a repertoire of calls that can mimic everything from hawk screams to squirrel chatters. It’s like having a feathered DJ in the neighborhood!
                    <p>So next time you spot a blue jay darting through the branches, take a moment to appreciate their vivid colors and lively antics. And who knows, maybe they’re discussing baseball strategy up there—after all, they share their name with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays">Toronto Blue Jays!</a>

                    <h1>It's heckin' COLD!</h1>
                    <img src="images/erin/erin-orig.png" alt="A Blue jay perches on a wire. Snow-covered branches are in the background." title="Snowy Blue Jay">
                    <p>In winter, blue jays rely on several strategies to survive the cold. They cache food like acorns and seeds in the fall, using their memory to retrieve these stores throughout the season. Their diet also includes insects, bird feeder offerings, and even carrion. Unlike their territorial behavior in warmer months, they become more social, forming loose flocks for protection and food. Blue jays tolerate the cold with thick feathers that provide insulation, and they often roost in dense evergreens for warmth. While some blue jays migrate, many stay in northern areas depending on food availability.
